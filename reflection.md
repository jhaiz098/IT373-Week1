# Reflection on Setup Process

Setting up the Django project was mostly straightforward, but I ran into a few challenges. First, I had an issue where **Python wasn't properly linked** to the terminal. This was fixed by updating my system PATH.

Next, I couldn't activate my virtual environment in **PowerShell** due to script restrictions. I solved this by changing the execution policy in PowerShell to allow script running, or I used Command Prompt as a workaround.

Lastly, I encountered errors with **Django not being found**. I resolved this by installing Django in the virtual environment with `pip install django`.

I also faced some issues with **Git**â€”specifically, creating a repository, committing, and pushing files. Since I was more familiar with the **GitHub Desktop app**, I switched to using the GUI to easily commit and push the files to the repository.

Overall, the process helped me get more familiar with virtual environments, Django setup, and handling basic errors during development, as well as learning how to troubleshoot Git-related issues.
